This repository demonstrates uncommon error handling scenarios in Python. The `bug.py` file contains a function that can throw TypeErrors (non-numeric operands in division) and ZeroDivisionErrors (division by zero). The `bugSolution.py` file presents solutions to catch and manage these potential issues.  The code includes both specific exception handling (for TypeError and ZeroDivisionError) as well as generic exception handling for unexpected errors.  This shows best practices for robust error handling.
